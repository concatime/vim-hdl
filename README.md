# vim-hdl

vim-hdl is a Vim plugin that uses [`hdlcc`][hdlcc] to provide some helpers to VHDL
development:

* Syntax checking using [Syntastic][Syntastic] along with third-party compilers
 supported by `hdlcc`. (see [`hdlcc`'s README]
 (https://github.com/suoto/hdlcc#supported-third-party-compilers) for an updated
 list)
* [Style checking](#style-checking)

## Usage

vim-hdl requires a configuration file listing libraries, source files,
build flags, etc. Select the configuration file via

```viml
let g:vimhdl_conf_file = '<config/file>'
```

See the [wiki](https://github.com/suoto/vim-hdl/wiki#project-file-formats) for
details on how to write it.

Any other [Syntastic][Syntastic] option should work as well.

You can clone [vim-hdl-examples][vim-hdl-examples] repository and try a ready-to-use
setup.
